Hello everyone, I'm back with another fun interactive project for you guys to try out. This time, I have re-created the popular
game Towers of Hanoi in Python. This game is very simple, but very fun as well. 

If you guys have any comments or want to report any bugs, please do feel free to reach me out on Instagram @jaivalpatelll

Have a great a day, and hope you enjoyed the project :)
